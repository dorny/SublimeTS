# SublimeTS

A [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/) package for the [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) language.

## Features:

* Syntax Definition
* Comments & Indentation Preferences
* Snippets

Main advantage of this plugin is actually working syntax definition.  
All other Sublime TypeScript plugins are using same old syntax definition which can't correctly handle
class methods or variable types.


This plugin does not provide typescript autocomple (performance issues) or
build system (use [grunt-ts](https://github.com/grunt-ts/grunt-ts) instead).
If you want "heavy IDE" features inside Sublime, look at [T3S](https://github.com/Railk/T3S).


## Credit

Syntax definition uses parts from Javacirpt JSX definition from Timothy Yung's [repo]([repo](https://github.com/yungsters/sublime).
